              Hello! I'm <strong className="text-pink-300">DhruvKumar Yadav</strong>, a dedicated and aspiring <strong className="text-blue-300">B.Tech Computer Science student</strong> at PP Savani University. I have a diploma in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for my passion for technology and innovation.

              I specialize in <strong className="text-pink-300">Full Stack Development</strong> and <strong className="text-blue-300">Frontend Development, Backend Development and Web Development</strong>. During my diploma, I gained hands-on experience in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React js, Tailwind css and Postgrey for Database. For my final-year project, my team and I developed an AI-powered Flutter application to help locate missing personsâ€”an experience that deepened my understanding of practical problem-solving using technology.
